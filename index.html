          <p>
            Founded in 2013, Zoomcar is the leading car-sharing platform in
            emerging markets. Zoomcar is headquartered in Bengaluru, India. With
            many unique advantages, the application helps self-driving car
            guests to choose and rent a car more easily. At the same time, car
            owners can share their cars with Zoomcar to earn extra income.
          </p>
          <h2>Why choose Zoomcar?</h2>
          <h3>NO DEPOSIT NEEDED</h3>
          <p>
            This is the most significant advantage you can only find at Zoomcar.
            Conditions for renting a self-driving car from traditional car
            owners always include leaving an amount of money (minimum 15
            million) and some important papers. Sometimes tenants can leave
            their motorbikes for a deposit. This, more or less also affects the
            psychology and finance of guests. Therefore, many tenants have used
            Zoomcar app for booking trips to avoid the initial hassle.
          </p>
          <h3>Hourly car rental feature (at least 8 hours)</h3>
          <p>
            With the service of individual car owners, the guests must pay a
            daily fee, although the demand for use may be less. On the other
            hand, at Zoomcar, you can book a car by the hour (at least 8 hours).
            Tenants can use the car more flexibly and economically.
          </p>
          <h3>Free cancellation 24 hours in advance</h3>
          <p>
            You can cancel the ride 24 hours in advance from the time of
            successful booking for any reason. This gives you more flexibility
            in managing your plan.
          </p>
          <h3>Zoomcar ride includes protection packages, avoiding risks</h3>
          <p>
            When booking a car on the app, you will see an option to choose the
            protection package when paying for the ride. You can choose to
            purchase a basic or premium plan. Each type of protection plan will
            correspond to a different price. This protection package makes sense
            when an unexpected accident occurs. At that time, you only need to
            pay a certain fee depending on the selected protection plan.
          </p>
          <h3>Unlimited KM</h3>
          <p>
            Another plus when renting a car at Zoomcar is that you can freely
            move as much as you like. We do not limit the distance when you rent
            a car.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Experience picking up/returning cars through the app, without direct
            contact with the car owner
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you are a person who is afraid to interact with strangers,
            consider Zoomcar when you want to rent a car. The process of
            booking/receiving/returning the car is all through the app, you can
            lock/unlock the car with the app when a ride is booked. The check-in
            and check-out photography procedures on the app help you avoid
            additional fees such as violating vehicle hygiene or not having
            enough initial fuel. Even if you have incurred costs, Zoomcar will
            also notify you later on the application, you do not need to deal
            directly with the car owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, when you wanted to rent a car, you had to find a car
            and consult the price in many places? Now with Zoomcar, renting a
            car has become easier. Just open the app and choose the right
            vehicle in your area. Information about the vehicle and the
            appropriate price (depending on the vehicle type/year of use) are
            displayed on the application. Thanks to that, you will find it more
            convenient to find a suitable car rental!
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, Zoomcar also has an airport service, which is very
            convenient for you when you need to move after a long tiring flight.

          <p class="para">
            We understand that driving can get tiring on a long drive and you
            want to share driving responsibilities with a friend. Simply add
            co-drivers through the Co-Drivers page in your account. This will
            ensure that in case of any damage while your friend is driving,
            liability is limited to the security deposit (under our usual
            conditions). If your friend is not a Zoomcar user already, we will
            ask them to upload their DL and then review it. If your friend is
            already a Zoomcar user then their DL has most likely already been
            approved. Please do remember, you are still responsible for the
            vehicle during your reservation. Additionally if a non-Zoomcar
            verified person drives the vehicle, Zoomcar's insurance coverage
            would be invalidated and you will face unlimited liability.

            plus an additional inconvenience fee of 100,000 VND will be
            applicable. (Refuelling charges = 23,000 VND x difference in fuel
            level + 100,000 VND).
